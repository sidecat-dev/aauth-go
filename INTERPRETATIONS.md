# Implementation interpretations

This file records choices needed where the pinned editor text is ambiguous or
internally inconsistent. Explicit requirements are implemented directly and do
not appear here. See [SPECIFICATIONS.md](SPECIFICATIONS.md) for the exact source
revisions.

## Four-party person identity uses `(ps, sub)`

**Source:** AAuth Core, `Auth Token Structure` and `Auth Token Verification`.

An auth token's `iss` names its issuer. In a four-party exchange that issuer is
the access server, while `ps` names the person server that owns the `sub`
namespace. The verification text nevertheless says that `(iss, sub)` identifies
the person.

The Resource exposes person identity to its protected handler as `(ps, sub)`.
A change of Access Server therefore does not change the identity pair, and the
same `sub` under two Person Servers still names two people. `tenant` is context,
not part of this pair. This library does not retain a person directory.

This choice follows the resource-token chain, where the resource copies `ps`
and `sub` from the verified person token. It also keeps the identity namespace
anchored at the server that created the directed identifier.

**Executable example:**
`resource/server_test.go:TestProtectedHandlerReceivesCurrentPrincipal`.

## Person-token policy denial uses `person_token_denied`

**Source:** AAuth Core, `Person Token Endpoint` and `Token Endpoint Error
Codes`.

The registered errors distinguish malformed or expired credentials from an
unreachable person, but do not name a valid request denied by person-server
policy.

The implementation returns HTTP `403` with
`error: "person_token_denied"` for that case. It does not reuse
`user_unreachable` or describe valid input as `invalid_request`.

This is a provisional extension, not a registered AAuth error. Clients must
treat an unknown terminal `403` as denial. The name can change when the Core
specification defines this result.

## Query-bearing requests cover `@query`

**Source:** AAuth Core, `Covered Components` and `Verification`; RFC 9421,
Section 2.2.7.

The mandatory Core set includes `@path`, which excludes the query. A signature
over only that set can therefore be replayed with another query on an endpoint
where query parameters select behavior.

The implementation adds `@query` whenever the request target has a query and
requires the verifier to cover the same value. A request without a query keeps
the four-component Core baseline. Changing the query after signing invalidates
the proof.

**Executable example:**
`signaturekey/request_external_test.go:TestRequestProofCoversAnExactQueryWhenPresent`
and `TestRequestProofCoversAnExplicitEmptyQuery`.

## Resource-managed sessions bind the stable Agent identity

**Source:** AAuth Core, `AAuth-Access` and `Agent Token Verification`.

Core says an opaque session token names a relationship with “this agent” and
must be accompanied by a valid Agent signature, but it does not say whether a
session survives rotation of the Agent token's `cnf` key.

The Resource binds a session to the Agent Provider, Agent identifier, and
optional parent Agent. Every request must still carry a current AP-issued
agent token and a matching HTTP proof. A new agent token for the same stable
identity may therefore poll and use the session with a new proof key; a token
for another Agent cannot. Reassigning the same Agent identifier at the AP also
preserves the session unless the Resource revokes it.

**Executable examples:**
`resource/session_test.go:TestResourceManagedInteractionApprovesAcrossRecompositionAndBindsStableAgent`
and `resource/session_test.go:TestSessionUseVerifiesProofBeforeLoadAndRejectsEveryBindingFailure`.

## `AAuth-Access` is an opaque credential, not a JWT profile

**Source:** AAuth Core, `Overview` and `AAuth-Access`.

The overview says all AAuth tokens are JWTs. The more specific
`AAuth-Access` section defines a Resource-owned opaque `token68`, permits it to
wrap an existing OAuth or session credential, and defines no JWT claims.

The library applies the specific `AAuth-Access` rules. It validates only the
`token68` wire form and never parses the credential as a JWT. Proof of
possession comes from the Agent signature covering `Authorization`, not from a
session-token `cnf` claim.

**Executable example:**
`integration/resource_managed_session_test.go:TestCurrentCoreResourceManagedSessionAcrossResourceRecomposition`.

## Four-party tenant context remains in the Person Server namespace

**Source:** AAuth Core, `Auth Token Structure` and `Person Token Structure`.

Core says `(iss, tenant)` identifies an organization, but four-party auth-token
`iss` names the Access Server while `tenant` is copied from the Person Server.
Changing Access Servers must not silently rename the organization.

The Resource therefore presents tenant beside `PersonIdentity{Issuer: ps,
Subject: sub}` in a separate `PersonContext`. Hosts that use tenant as an
organization hint interpret it in the Person Server namespace. Tenant does not
participate in stable person matching.

## Authorization requests always bind their JSON body

**Source:** AAuth Core, `Authorization Endpoint Request`, `Covered Components`,
and `Resource Metadata`.

The authorization request carries `scope`, which decides what the Resource
may issue. Applying `additional_signature_components` globally cannot safely
solve this for Resources that also have bodyless protected routes.

This implementation always signs and requires `content-type` and
`content-digest` at `/authorize`, then adds the Resource's advertised
components. Advertised components alone govern ordinary protected routes. A
transport-mutation test proves that changing `scope` after signing is refused.

**Executable example:**
`integration/core_four_party_test.go:TestCurrentCoreFourParty`.

## A bodyless poll can cover the digest of empty content

**Source:** AAuth Core, `Resource Metadata` and `Polling with GET`; RFC 9530,
Sections 2 and 6.3.

Core requires every Resource-advertised signature component on Resource
requests, while polling switches to `GET` without resending the original body.
RFC 9530 permits `Content-Digest` over empty content to prove that no content
was added.

When a poll profile includes `content-digest`, the signer emits the SHA-256
digest of empty content and leaves the request body absent. The caller supplies
fresh values for any other advertised header fields through
`PollResourceSessionWithComponents`.

**Executable example:**
`integration/resource_managed_session_test.go:TestCurrentCoreResourceManagedSessionAcrossResourceRecomposition`.

## Failed JWKS refresh may use the bounded cached entry

**Source:** AAuth Core, `JWKS Discovery and Caching`; Signature-Key, `Caching
and Performance`.

Signature-Key says to respect HTTP freshness. Core adds the AAuth-specific
outage rule: after a fetch failure, use an available cached JWKS and discard it
after at most 24 hours.

The resolver attempts refresh when HTTP freshness expires. If that attempt
fails, it follows Core and may use the previously cached key until the fixed
24-hour discard bound. It never extends that bound from a failed request.

**Executable example:**
`signaturekey/discovery_external_test.go:TestHTTPKeyResolverUsesStaleCacheOnlyWithinCoreDiscardBound`.

## Held replay binds the exact compact auth token

**Source:** AAuth Core, `Deferred Delivery`.

Core requires a repeated presentation of “the same auth token” to replay a
held invocation, but it does not define whether sameness means claims, `jti`,
signature, or compact serialization. Its general Pending URL Security section
also says every poll after a terminal response must return `410 Gone`, which
contradicts the held-delivery replay requirement.

`HeldInvocationStore.Claim` receives the SHA-256 digest of the exact compact
token bytes. Only that exact token can replay the retained result. A separately
signed token with identical claims cannot consume the record. The
held-delivery replay rule is treated as the specific exception to the general
`410 Gone` rule, and remains available until the auth token expires.

**Executable example:**
`resource/held_test.go:TestHeldAuthTokenInvocationCompletesOnceAndReplays`.

## A lost held execution is never reclaimed automatically

**Source:** AAuth Core, `Deferred Delivery`.

Core prohibits re-executing a completed held invocation, but it does not define
a recovery protocol for a Resource process that stops after an atomic claim and
before durable result retention. Reclaiming after a timeout could execute an
application consequence twice.

This implementation has no lease or reclaim transition. After an indeterminate
claim or retention result, the store exposes either a committed replay or
`ErrHeldExecutionUnresolved`. A caller can start a new application request, but
the original pending record never becomes executable again.

An unresolved poll returns the registered `500 server_error`. It does not use
`503`: the implementation has no retry schedule or condition under which that
record becomes executable again.

The test below injects an uncertain `Retain` result into the store contract.
This repository has no durable adapter or process-restart proof.

**Executable example:**
`resource/held_test.go:TestHeldAuthTokenRetainFailureWithholdsResultAndNeverReexecutes`.

## An application `202` starts a nested deferred response

**Source:** AAuth Core, `Deferred Delivery` and `Deferred Responses`.

Core says the held poll returns the invocation's response and separately says
every `202` is a deferred response whose polling ends only on a non-`202`.

When the protected application returns `202`, the Resource treats it as the
retained result only if it contains a same-origin `Location`, decimal
`Retry-After`, `Cache-Control: no-store`, and an unambiguous
`application/json` body with `status`. The original held record then replays
that response. `PollAuthToken` returns it without following the new location;
the caller can continue that separate deferred operation explicitly.

**Executable example:**
`resource/held_test.go:TestHeldAuthTokenRetainsWellFormedApplicationPendingResponse`.

## Deferred PS consent expires with the original resource token

**Source:** AAuth Core, `Resource Token Structure`, `PS Token Endpoint`, and
`Deferred Responses`.

Core tells an Agent to obtain a fresh resource token when an AS exchange is
delayed past expiry, but does not say whether a three-party PS may decide after
the resource token used to create its pending request expires.

The three-party pending deadline is the earliest of the host policy lifetime,
the initial Agent-token expiry, and the original resource-token expiry. This
keeps a later approval inside every credential bound that justified creating
the pending request.

After the first terminal response, the store marks the pending URL gone. Core
does not register a separate error name for that state, so the implementation
uses `410 invalid_code`, the registered result for a consumed or unrecognized
interaction code.

**Executable examples:**
`personserver/authorization_interaction_test.go:TestDeferredAuthorizationDecisionRacesAndDeadlineAreTerminal`
and
`integration/deferred_ps_authorization_test.go:TestCurrentCoreDeferredPSAuthorizationAcrossRecomposition`.

## Three choices for bounded three-party revocation

**Source:** AAuth Core, `Token Revocation`, `Keying Material`, `Covered
Components`, `Authentication Errors`, and `Verification (Server)`.

### Server identity and body binding

The revocation example uses `scheme=jwt`, but a three-party auth token binds
the Agent's key, not the issuing Person Server's key. The example also signs no
body component even though `(iss, jti)` selects the token to terminate.

The Person Server therefore signs `/revoke` with its existing `jwks_uri`
server identity. Both sides require `content-type`, `content-digest`, and the
Resource's advertised components. The Resource accepts only the PS that equals
the token issuer in this three-party path.

### Refusal after revocation

A revoked token still has a valid signature and request proof. Because Core
does not define the protected-use response, this implementation provisionally
returns `403 access_denied` rather than a misleading `401 Signature-Error`.
This check stops a request only when the store reports revocation before host
callbacks; it does not cancel an already-admitted in-flight request.

### No pre-use tombstone

The Resource returns `404` when it has not yet observed `(iss, jti)`; it does
not invent a pre-use tombstone from an underspecified request.

**Executable examples:**
`resource/revocation_test.go:TestRevocationEndpointRequiresBoundPersonServerProof`
and
`integration/revocation_reauthorization_test.go:TestThreePartyRevocationAndExplicitReauthorizationAcrossResourceRecomposition`.
